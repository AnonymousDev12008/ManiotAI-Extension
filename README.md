Maniot is an AI extension for developers that enhances their coding experience by providing several useful features. The extension integrates seamlessly with your coding environment and provides a sidebar that displays relevant information and tools to streamline your workflow.

One of the key features of Maniot is its auto code correct functionality. The extension uses machine learning algorithms to detect errors in your code and provides suggestions to fix them. This can save developers a significant amount of time, as they no longer have to manually identify and correct errors.

In addition to auto code correct, Maniot also includes an auto debugger that automatically detects and debugs errors in your code. This helps developers to quickly identify and fix issues, improving the quality and efficiency of their code.

Maniot also includes an inline chat palette, which enables developers to collaborate in real-time with their colleagues. This can be especially useful for remote teams, as it allows developers to communicate without leaving their coding environment.

Finally, Maniot provides inline suggestions that appear as you type. These suggestions are based on the context of your code and can help you to write more efficient and error-free code.

Overall, Maniot is a powerful AI extension that provides several useful features to help developers improve their coding experience and productivity.
